Phase 1: Examine string that is being compared, use that as answer
Phase 2:
Phase 3:
Phase 4:
Phase 5: Expects two integers. First input must equal not be 15.  Array of 16 
    elements containing values 0 through 15, corresponding to the array index, 
    but in random order. Second input should be sum of array elements, 115. 
    First input is an element to access in the array. A do/while loop is used 
    access the array, which executes as long as the current array value is not 15.
    The loop must run 15 times (edx++) to avoid explosion, so the first element 
    access point must weave a route that yields 15 iterations. Wrote out array 
    and discovered that.
